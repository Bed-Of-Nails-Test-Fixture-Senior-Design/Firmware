# Firmware

SAM3X8C Datasheet: https://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/devicedoc/atmel-11057-32-bit-cortex-m3-microcontroller-sam3x-sam3a_datasheet.pdf

## Uploading Firmware to Arduino

Requirements:
1. Python
2. Arduino Due plugged into computer

Process:
Run upload.sh (either by double clicking or `./upload.sh` from within terminal)

This is a demonstration

The program will autolocate the port for your connected Arduino Due, therefore you should only have one Arduino Due plugged in at a time.
